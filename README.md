# Physics-Quiz-App
This is a GUI made specifically for IB Physics students to revise their material

Goal:
As a graduated IB student, I have learned the struggles to find question banks online while trying to maintain study efficiency. Thus, I created this GUI to help students in their revision sessions.

Key insights:
GUIs are very easy and intuitive to make but take a long time to setup the layout.
Libraries like Apache POI facilitate the usage of external tools like Excel during program development.
Using the MVC model to organize the classes is a helpful way to structure code and maintain readability over time or in collaborative environments.
